## Question 2

Assume you have an endpoint (Example 1 below) that returns a JSON output (Example 2) when a GET request is performed and write a code snippet in Python and Javascript that performs a GET request to the Example 1 endpoint and loops through the JSON output from Example 2. Print the `name` and `id` fields, sorting by the `id` field.

# Bonus points

Write a code snippet that does the same using cURL and/or Node.js.

# Example 1

`https://www.example.com/data`

# Example 2

```
{
    data: [{
        id: 1,
        name: "Item 1"
    }, {
        id: 3,
        name: "Item 3"
    }, {
        id: 2,
        name: "Item 2",
    }, {
        id: 4,
        name: "Item 4"
    ]
}
```

Integrate the code from Question 1 into a ReactJS application and display the `id` and `name` fields on the page as HTML. Use CSS to make it look nice. Upload code to Github or any other site of your choosing.
